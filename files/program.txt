As someone who was not very familiar with programming at the start of my first year, I was definitely overwhelmed by the fact that there's so much 
more to explore in this feild and to prove myself. The transition from school to college is not so easy, in college you are going to meet people who
know more than you do, while some may seem enjoying their college life. This creates a lot of pressure and internal conflicts.

The fact is everyone learns at their own pace and has their own way of doing things, and that's what I have learnt during my first year of college. 
At first I was overwhelmed by the surge of languages I can learn, but it all boils down to one thing, one big question Why there are so many Languages??
And what language should I choose. I was lucky enough that my one professor was really mindful to address this.

What I have learned is, a programmer's job is so cool- being able to solve problems using technology. The problem solving aspect is what makes it 
more interesting. I participated in my first ever hackathon, that really opened my eyes and gave me wonderful insights.
