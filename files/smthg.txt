Hello everyone. I am Vaishnavi Shambharkar, the one behind this page. I am a Computer Engineering student who takes some time out to read and
write. Since I started reading novels, I knew I wanted to write and I enjoy immersing myself into a fantasy world. Writing has helped me during 
my toughest times, when I couldn't tell anyone what I was going through, I poured my heart out through writing. I have really admired how many 
artists really put everything they are going through into their work, and that's what I would love to do. This page features everything that
comes into my mind and I write it down- right from Book recommendations, Book reviews , my opinions on book adaptations, my take on technology 
and glimpses from my life.                                      

It all started when I read my first novel, back in 2019, which was Alchemist by Paulo Coelho. However I stopped reading during my JEE preparation,
and I  try to read whenever I get time. Now that I am in college, I realized that I don't write as often as I used to and thus I decided to start
this Personal Blog Page - 'Pages & Passages'. Now I am reading this novel called 'The Lives not Lived', which I will probably be done reading with 
by the time I post this. Some book recommendations and reviews will be coming very soon. 

I really hope you guys enjoy my writing and my blogs which will be coming up every week. I look forward to keep writing and posting on this page
frequently. 
Until then Happy reading and Happy writing!
